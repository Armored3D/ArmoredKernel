# ArmoredKernel :crab:
An Open Source brand new modelling kernel built in rust.

Our aim is to provide a viable and modern aternative to the other geometric kernels.

While there are FOSS alternatives to proprietary softwares like Freecad, they are often sketchy and extremely frustrating to use.

Since open software is the only way to go, we wish to compete with kernels like ACIS.

Our code is aimed to be reliable while keeping it fast. The quite young Rust language is by far one of the best choices, because of its memory safety features and its execution speed.

Rust makes development of complex Open Source software by te community easier and safer.

Also, please note that this is a research project, driven by engineering students. It means that there will be trials and errors, and that you should not expect it to be the best software ever in the beginning at least :)

We will also try to use modern tools like generative AI.

Do not hesitate to leave critics through the discussion feature in github, because, we are here to learn, and feedback is one of the best ways !

## Armored Kernel

The geometric kernel is there to provide the base of new open source CAD/CAM softwares.

It will be ale to :
* Provide a full CAD 
* 

## Parts

The parts functionality is there to provide all the tools to model unique parts.

### Sketch

Will include for drawing :

* Line
* Circle
  * Center radius
  * Three points
* Arc
* Fillet
* Chamfer
* Text
* Point
* Geometry projection
* Move
* Copy
* Rotate
* Trim
* Extend

### 3D features

#### Make

Will include :

* Extrusion
* Revolution
* Sweep
* Loft
* Coil
* Embossing

To be thought of :

* Coil
* Derive
* Rib
* Decal
* Import
* Unwrap

#### Mods

* Hole
* Chamfer
* Fillet
* Shell
* Draft
* Thread
* Combine
* Thicken/offste
* Split
* Direct/Pull

#### Refs

* Plane
* Axis
* Point

### File syntax

The file extension will be .arp (for armored part).

## Blueprints

Once parts are created/imported, they can be set on paper.

## Assemblies

The assemblies functionality is there to provide the possibility to work with assemblies of courses, but will also provide other tools like finite elements, or cinematic simulation.

### Assembly (core)

Main assembly functions : 

### FEA (finite element analysis)

### Animation-simulation

Should provide a way to play and with associated parameters, output moves.
